However, working backwards and noticing that generally secondary stats progress linearly with item level it becomes clear that secondary stat multiplier is driven by a function that when multiplied by budget yields a linear expression.</p> <p>What function when multiplied by <code>B(x)</code> produces <code>bx+c</code>, simply \\(\\frac{bx+c}{B(x)}\\) and that fits the multiplier data exactly, so in a roundabout way we get that secondaries are driven by <code>S(x)=bx+c</code>. Which means every item level, you get exactly <code>b</code> secondary stats regardless of what item level it is. In the case of the 'Super Sword' we don't care what item level it is, for every item level it gains exactly <code>b</code> secondaries. An additional distinction is that jewelry uses a different linear curve than other items.</p> <p>Stamina multiplier is also a function of item level, unlike secondaries however the multiplier increases linearly with item level and we get <code>H(x)=(bx+c)*B(x)</code> as the function for the amount of stamina on an item.</p> <p>This is harder to quantify, but essentially the amount of stamina you gain per item level both depends on how much stamina the item has (exponential) and also increases with item level it also means you gain more stamina throughout the progression than you do primary stat.</p> <p>Armor doesn't use budget, instead the function that drives it is of the form \\(a*1.15^{\\frac{1}{15}*x}+b\\), which is very close to a pure exponential.</p> <p>Effects trinket like effects have their own unique scaling which is similar to stamina in that they are linear * exponential, ie. \\((bx+c)*1.15^{\\frac{1}{15}*x}\\).</p>"},{"location":"system/stat-scaling/#appendix-exact-values-in-shadowlands","title":"Appendix: exact values in Shadowlands","text":""}]}
