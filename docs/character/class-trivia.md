### Holy Shield

Despite the description does not allow you to **block** spells, it grants you the ability to absorb spells, it does not require a shield to activate or face the target or in fact even have a target.

It's an absorb that has a chance equal to you block chance to proc and it's value is based on the block value of your shield.

For example not having a shield equipped will still proc Holy Shield that doesn't absorb anything (since your block value is 0) but deals damage if the damage that was 'absorbed' is sourced to a valid target.

From the above the two effects (absorb and damage) can both happen or only one can, though damaging a target and not absorbing is fairly unlikely unless you for some reason chose to not use a shield.

### Blessed Hammer

Rotates clockwise in an [Archimedean spiral](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/gfmndxsmek){target=_blank} starting directly behind you (3/2pi) and finishing 2 rotations after 5 seconds at the same angle reaching roughly 10y range at the final point.

It can hit the same target anywhere from 0 to N times depending on the size of target's hit box, presumably every time it intersects the hit box (usually ~2 hits on normal sized mobs).

The debuff it applies 'works' on **any** damage as long as it's sourced to the target with the debuff.
